* Small fix to make fsf virtualenv compatible

04/27/2016
----------

* Added new module:
   * EXTRACT_HEXASCII_PE - Snag encoded PE files inside of files (example in source)

* Added new Yara signatures:
   * misc_hexascii_pe_in_html
   * misc_no_dosmode_header

02/11/2016
----------

* Formal 1.0 stable release :)

* Removal of '--interactive' and '--not-interactive' modes from client/server

* Introduction of new flags to the client to support more flexibility 
	* Added '--source', to specify the source of the input. Useful when scaling up to larger operations or supporting multiple sources; such as integrating with a sensor grid or other network defense solutions. Defaults to 'Analyst' as submission source
	* Added '--delete' to remove file from client after sent to FSF server. Data can be archived later on server depending on selected options
	* Added '--archive' to specify how the file submission should be stored on the server (if at all)
		* The most common option is 'none' which will tell the server not to archive for this submission (default)
		* 'file-on-alert' will archive the file only if the alert flag is set
		* 'all-on-alert' will archive the file and all sub objects if the alert flag is set
		* 'all-the-files' will archive all the files sent to the scanner regardless of the alert flag
		* 'all-the-things' will archive the file and all sub objects regardless of the alert flag
	* Added '--suppress-report', don't return a JSON report back to the client and log client-side errors to the locally configured log directory. Choosing this will log scan results server-side only. Needed for automated scanning use cases when sending large amount of files for bulk collection. Set to false by default.

* Updated documentation:
	* New process flow diagram to reflect changes
	* New overview picture to get rid of old 'interactive modes'
	* Updated [modules](https://github.com/EmersonElectricCo/fsf/blob/master/docs/MODULES.md) to reflect removal of 'interactive' modes and addition of new flags
	* Added a few usage notes to the readme based on the recent changes
		* fsf_client -h output
	* Added a module matrix to give an overview of capabilities

* Updated installation docs to include cabextract and latest pefile module

* Added new module:
	* EXTRACT_CAB - Extract contents and metadata of MS CAB files. Requires installation of cabextract utility

* Improved some modules:
	* META_PE - Now includes metadata for the entry point, image base, and import hash. Requires latest pefile module (>= 1.2.10-139)
	* META_BASIC_INFO - Made this an ordered dictionary for display reasons

* Core changes to address some minor bugs.
	* Added server side timeout condition in off chance where client terminates connection mid transfer
	* Added small sanity check to verify input is from a true FSF client 

* Added new Yara signatures:

* NOTE - please ensure you have the OpenSSL development libraries installed (openssl-devel for RH distros, libssl-dev for Debian) before installing Yara. Otherwise signatures like the newly added `misc_pe_signature.yara` will not work! If you don't have these, please install them and then reinstall Yara. This has been captured in [Yara Issue #378](https://github.com/plusvic/yara/issues/378).

* Updated installation requirements to include Python modules pyasn1 and pyasn1-modules. This is necessary to use META_PE_SIGNATURE.

* Added new modules:
 * EXTRACT_RTF_OBJ - Get embedded, hexascii encoded, OLE objects within RTFs.
 * EXTRACT_TAR - Get metadata and embedded objects within a TAR file and extract them. Some interesting goodies in TAR metadata, you should check it out!
 * EXTRACT_GZIP - Get embedded file within GZIP archive and extract it
 * META_PE_SIGNATURE - Get certificate metadata from PE files. Long overdue and really useful I hope!

* Improved some modules:
 * META_PE - Now delivers information on PE imports and export entries as appropriate, also provides version info 
 * EXTRACT_ZIP - More generous on corrupt ZIP files. It will now process embedded archives the best it can, if one is corrupt, it will move to the next instead of failing entirely
 * EXTRACT_RAR - Removed StringIO module in imports, was unnecessary

* Added a section on jq tippers for help interacting FSF JSON output in docs
 * Filter out multiple nodes from JSON output
 * Show results from only one module
 * Contribute your own creative jq-fu!

* Updated Test.json to accommodate output from module additions

* Updated README.md with notes on jq use with FSF data

* Added new Yara signatures:
 * ft_gzip.yara
 * ft_rtf.yara
 * ft_tar.yara
 * misc_pe_signature.yara

* Docker image updated (thanks wzod!)
